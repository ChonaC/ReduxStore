# Redux_Store

## Description
This application allows the user to sign up for an account. The user can then log in to their account. The application will show items that are for sale which includes the picture, description, price, and quantity left. When the user clicks on add to cart, their cart on the top right will show what was added. As the user adds more items, the cart will continue to add items but also show the total amount of their cart. When the user clicks on the cart, the user will get directed to a new page where they can enter their card information to finalize their purchase. The user can then finally check order history and also log out of their account.
